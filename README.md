# Predict-the-unpredictable-
This project is about predicting the customer demand in fashion industry. In the paper, "Demand Forecasting in the Fashion Industry: A Review" by Maria Elena Nenni, Luca Giustiniano and Luca Pirolo in the International Journal of Engineering Business Management, the authors listed the challenges of forecasting demand in the fashion industry: short product life-cycles, short selling season, long replenishment lead time, high impusle purchasing, high volatility, high varance, lack of historical data. Therefore, as the authors state: "the reality that is now gradually being accepted both by those who work in the industry and those who research forecasting is that the demand for fashion products cannot be forecast."
