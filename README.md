# Predict-the-unpredictable-
This project is about predicting the customer demand in fashion industry. In the paper, "Demand Forecasting in the Fashion Industry: A Review" by Maria Elena Nenni, Luca Giustiniano and Luca Pirolo in the International Journal of Engineering Business Management, the authors listed the issues of forecasting demand in the fashion industry: short product life-cycles, short selling season, long replenishment lead time, high impusle purchasing, high volatility, high varance, lack of historical data. All these issues pose great challenges for forecasting demand accuratly; therefore, as the authors state: "the reality that is now gradually being accepted both by those who work in the industry and those who research forecasting is that the demand for fashion products cannot be forecast."  

However, I was fortunate enough to encounter such problem right out of college. I was offered a job as the purchasing supervisor at Oak Patch Gifts, a local wholesaler that distributes fashion jewelries and gifts across the states. Part of my reponsibilities was to forecast demand for all of their products including four major product lines and each line has items ranging between a few dozens to couple hundreds.
